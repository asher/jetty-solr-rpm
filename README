RPM build for Solr using builtin Jetty and logback logging

solr version 4.2.1
jetty version 8.1.8.v20121106
slf4j version 1.7.5
logback version 1.0.11


goal is a relatively plain vanilla rpm for solr on jetty deployments
  -all logging using similar configuration (rotation, etc)
  -detail configs would be controlled via chef
