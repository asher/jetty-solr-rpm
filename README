RPM build for Solr using builtin Jetty and logback logging framework

solr version 4.2.1
jetty version 8.1.8.v20121106
slf4j version 1.7.5
logback version 1.0.11


goal is a relatively plain vanilla rpm for solr on jetty deployments
  -all logging using similar configuration (rotation, etc)
  -detail configs would be controlled via chef

JMX interface is enabled on TCP port 1099 with simple authentication
  -read access credentials: monitorRole/mrpasswd
  -read/write access credentials: controlRole/crpasswd
  -reference: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JMX

RPM build process was adapted from https://github.com/jfroche/solr-rpm
