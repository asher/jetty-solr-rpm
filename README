RPM build for Solr using builtin Jetty

solr version 4.5.1
jetty version 8.1.10.v20130312


goal is a serviceable base rpm for deployment of solr on jetty

Logging is now handled by log4j framework (i prefer logback, but the Web UI in solr doesnt yet work correctly with logback)
  -logging for jetty, solr, and the local zookeeper services is using similar configuration settings (rotation, formatting, etc)
  -RFC3339 datetime format + local TZ label for service log events
  -combined format for jetty HTTP request logs
  NOTE: GC logging is not handled by log4j, rotated by JVM
  NOTE: jetty start log is not handled by log4j, not rotated

JMX interface is enabled in a firewall friendly manner on TCP port 1099 with simple authentication
  -read access credentials: monitorRole/mrpasswd
  -read/write access credentials: controlRole/crpasswd
  -reference: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JMX

very basic script to send emails on java errors or OOM
