RPM build for Solr using builtin Jetty and logback logging framework

solr version 4.3.0
jetty version 8.1.10.v20130312
slf4j version 1.7.5
logback version 1.0.12


goal is a serviceable base rpm for deployment of solr on jetty

Logging is handled by logback framework
  -logging for jetty, solr, and the local zookeeper services is using similar configuration settings (rotation, formatting, etc)
  -GC logging is not handled by logback
  -jetty start log is not handled by logback

JMX interface is enabled on TCP port 1099 with simple authentication
  -read access credentials: monitorRole/mrpasswd
  -read/write access credentials: controlRole/crpasswd
  -reference: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JMX

very basic script to send emails on java errors or OOM


RPM build process was adapted from https://github.com/jfroche/solr-rpm
